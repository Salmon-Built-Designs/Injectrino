- Stoppable for security
- Idle Test (800 RPM, 50% duty cycle)
- On Load Test (7500 RPM, 85% duty cycle)
- Leak Test: 10 seconds with diferent RPM and DC then stop
- Manual Test: User defined RPM, duration and duty cycle
- Up to 4 injectors selectable
- Batch and Sequential injection
- Selectable injections per cycle (360 mode and 720 mode)
